# Scalable Dto Mapper Generator
SDMapGen is an Eclipse plugin for Java that generate the mapping source code.
Why generate source code?. Some of us beleive that coded mappig is better than runtime mapper, because is faster and you can review it. 
It's scalable because you can add classes for generate mapping code of types not included and add then by an xml config file.
